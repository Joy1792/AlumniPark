<em>Description: </em>The VE Group is working together with the UW Foundation on a portable VR HMD system for a preview display of the new UW Alumni Park, currently under construction adjacent to the Memorial Union Terrace.  The project will be shown off at a public event out at the University Ridge golf course and eventually be housed at the new One Alumni Place Alumni Visitors Center!
